    title: 'Spa-Like Bathroom Retreat',
    category: 'Bathroom',
    location: 'Pacific Heights, San Francisco',
    duration: '6 weeks',
    budget: '$75,000',
    description: 'A complete transformation of a dated master bathroom into a luxurious spa-like retreat. This project focused on creating a serene and relaxing environment while maximizing the use of natural light and incorporating high-end materials.',
    challenge: 'The main challenge was working within the existing plumbing layout while creating a more spacious feel in the relatively compact bathroom.',
    solution: 'We optimized the layout by removing a bulky built-in tub and replacing it with a freestanding soaking tub. The shower area was expanded and fitted with frameless glass doors to create an open feel. Strategic placement of mirrors and lighting enhanced the sense of space.',

    description: 'A bright and airy dining room transformation that brings the coastal atmosphere indoors. The design combines natural textures, ocean-inspired colors, and elegant furnishings to create a sophisticated yet relaxed dining space.',
    challenge: `The room lacked natural light and felt disconnected from the rest of the home's coastal aesthetic.`,
